Novel approach to pull back to monomodal state using current modualation

fig10.fig - Number of modes at Lext=0.1 m at C=1:8

fig11.fig - fig17.fig  Number of modes at Lext=0.2 to 0.8 m at C=1:8 respectively

Nm_C_Am_Lext.xlxs - conditions at with the laser attains mono-mode at different values of C and modulation current
  (a)Sheet Lext1: Lext8 correspond to Lext=0.1 m to 0.8 m with increment step 0.1 m
  (b)row 1:row 5 correspond to modulation current from 0.01:0.05 
  (c)col 1:col 8 correspond to C from 1:8
